# Health_Care_Website     One stop solution to take care of your health as developers 👩‍💻






One-stop solution to take care of your health as developers. Health Care will help you to take care of your back, eyes, and ears while working. The solutions we are working with are as follows:


Features

Back health:
For back health, the app has the feature of posture detection. It detects your posture at regular intervals and reminds you to sit straight if you are not.

Eyes health:
To relax your eyes there is a 20-20-20 rule which states that:

For every 20 minutes spent looking at a screen, a person should look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds

This exercise relaxes our eyes and reduces eye strain. The app reminds you to follow this exercise at regular intervals.

Ear health:
For ear health, there is a 60-60 rule:

Only turn your device volume up to 60% and listen for no more than 60 minutes per day

The app checks if you are using earphones for longer than 60 minutes and reminds you to control your earphone usage if it is becoming unhealthy.


App walkthrough ✨


Onboarding👋

When a user visits the app for the first time, initial information and instructions are displayed to the user to make them familiar with the app. This app doesn’t require a login or signup.

Posture detection initial setup🧍‍♂️

The app first needs to understand what a good posture is and what a bad posture is. For that, you’ll need to click at least 10 pictures for both cases. The app will learn from those images what a correct and incorrect posture is. After which, at regular intervals, the app will be able to check your posture and further inform you if it is not correct.

Dashboard 🏠

The dashboard displays the countdown timer. You can start and stop it whenever you want. You can opt to select only a few options to receive notifications for between back care, eye care, and ear care. Additionally, the app has a sweet cartoon creator whose mood will depend on how effectively you use this app.

You’ll receive reminders for doing the exercise, if your posture is incorrect and if you are using your earphones more than the limit at regular intervals.

Analysis📊

Dev Care will perform an analysis of your habits and visualize them through different charts. For back care, a pie chart is used to visualize how many times you are found sitting in good and bad posture. For eye care, a line chart is used to depict how many times a day you follow the exercise. For ear care, a bar graph is used to depict the daily usage of earphones.
